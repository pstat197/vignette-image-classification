## CNN Model

Based on our implementation and training results, one of the models we used was an improved Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. CNNs rely on convolutional layers that progressively extract hierarchical features from images—starting from simple edges and textures to more complex shapes and object patterns. This layered, spatially local approach allows CNNs to perform exceptionally well on visual tasks, even with relatively small datasets. In our experiments, the improved CNN architecture incorporated multiple convolutional and pooling layers, data augmentation, dropout for regularization, and early stopping to prevent overfitting. Compared to the earlier baseline model, the improved CNN showed higher stability and reproducibility across runs, maintaining consistent training accuracies between 91–100% and validation accuracies of 100% on the small validation set. However, when evaluated on the unseen test data, the model achieved 50% accuracy, suggesting that while the CNN effectively memorized patterns from the limited training samples, it struggled to generalize due to the small dataset size. Overall, the improved CNN demonstrates strong learning capacity and efficient convergence, but highlights the importance of using a larger and more diverse dataset to achieve robust real-world performance.
